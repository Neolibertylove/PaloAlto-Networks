# PaloAlto-Networks

When we talk about network security in computing context a firewall is one of the most important security tools. 
According to the evolution of firewalls there are 
1st generation “packet filter
2nd generation “stateful filter
3rd generation “application layer
The last one is where Palo Alto firewall fits but with extra features so they call it “Next Generation Firewall”.
This project has been developed by students from Lillebealt Academy in Odense Denmark, during the 3rd Semester in IT Technology Networks. 
The purpose of this project consists of obtaining the basic knowledge of Palo Alto firewalls following the Palo Alto course material .
